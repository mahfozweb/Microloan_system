# 🎨 LoanLink Frontend

This is the React-based frontend for the LoanLink platform. It uses Vite for lightning-fast development and build times, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Specifics

- **React 18**: Core library for UI.
- **Vite 7**: Next-generation frontend tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first CSS framework for modern designs.
- **Framer Motion**: Powerful animation library for React.
- **Firebase**: Used for secure authentication and potential real-time database needs.
- **React Router 7**: Declarative routing for React applications.

## 🔧 Available Scripts

In the `client` directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
